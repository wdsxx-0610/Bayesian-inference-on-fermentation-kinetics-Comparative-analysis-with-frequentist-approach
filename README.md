# Bayesian-inference-in-fermentation-compared-with-frequentist-method
This study explores the application of Bayesian inference to fermentation kinetic modeling, focusing on two representative batch systems: glycerol-glucose co-fermentation for 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) production and dark fermentation for biohydrogen production.
